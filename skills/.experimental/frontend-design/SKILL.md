# Frontend Design

This skill is for **frontend interface design + implementation**. Use it whenever the user wants you to build a working UI (components, pages, landing pages, dashboards, poster-like web artifacts, HTML/CSS layouts, UI redesigns, or “make it look good”). The goal is to produce interfaces with a clear point of view, high craft, and real personality—avoiding template-y, generic “AI slop” aesthetics.

## How to work

Before you write code, decide the design. Make a **bold, explicit** aesthetic choice, then execute it consistently.

### 1 Design thinking

Answer these first (write them down in your output or keep them as your internal checklist):

- **Purpose**: what problem it solves, who it’s for
- **Tone**: pick a strong direction and commit
- **Constraints**: stack, performance, accessibility, brand limits
- **Differentiation**: one unforgettable “signature moment”

Example directions (choose one, or combine with a clear primary axis):
- brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic natural, luxury refined, toy-like playful, editorial magazine, brutalist raw, art deco geometric, soft pastel, industrial utilitarian

It’s not about intensity—it’s about intent and consistency.

### 2 Deliverable bar

Your output must be:

- **Working**: runnable code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.)
- **Production-grade**: clean structure, maintainable, basic accessibility (keyboard, contrast, semantics)
- **Cohesive**: layout, type, color, motion all serve the same direction
- **Meticulously refined**: spacing, alignment, hierarchy, shadows, borders, micro-interactions

## Aesthetics guidelines

### Typography

- Pick **characterful** type pairing: a display face + a body face
- Avoid default-safe, generic choices (Arial, Inter, etc.)
- Treat size, line-height, tracking like design decisions—not defaults

### Color and theme

- Use CSS variables for colors, spacing, radii, shadows
- Prefer “dominant base + sharp accent” over timid evenly-distributed palettes
- Avoid cliché schemes (especially the generic purple gradient on white)

### Motion

- Create a “hero moment”: one orchestrated staggered entrance beats random micro-animations
- For HTML, prefer CSS motion; for React, use an animation library when appropriate
- Hover, focus, and scroll interactions must reinforce mood and hierarchy

### Composition and spacing

- Use asymmetry, overlap, grid breaks, or diagonal rhythm to create a signature
- Either generous negative space or controlled density—just stay consistent

### Backgrounds and texture

Don’t default to flat solid backgrounds. Build atmosphere and depth:

- gradient meshes, noise grain, geometric patterns, translucent layers, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, glow, subtle materials

## Don’ts

Avoid generic template UI:

- overused layout patterns and component stacks
- generic type and color that could be any template site
- “safe design” with no clear thesis or memorable signature

## Final reminder

Match complexity to the vision:
- maximalism needs layers, textures, motion, and crafted detail
- minimalism needs stricter grids, spacing, typography, and restraint

Beauty comes from consistency and detail—not from piling on effects.
